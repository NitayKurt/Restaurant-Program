# Restaurant-Program🍴
This project was made with 3 of my friends for a task at Ariel University. 
Restaurant Program IN PYTHON🐍
In this project, we made a virtual menu for managing the restaurant + ordering in the restaurant.
Imagine that you use a tablet and from this tablet, you can manage your restaurant and see which worker is in the shift right now...send him actions to do. etc.
Or you are sitting in the restaurant and want to order from a virtual menu and so on...

# At the start of the program loads all the waiters that starting the shift and what they do right now.
